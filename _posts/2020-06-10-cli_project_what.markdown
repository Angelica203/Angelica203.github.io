All i can say is wow! From being introduced to coding, learning new material in the first mile and after to, Now i have to build my own app ðŸ˜³. Well i can say it was a bit intimidating at first cause im still learning to comprehend *Ruby*. But putting time into my *Cli_project* i learned so much. It lead me to go back to study the basics also to do tons of reasearch for every little thing i didnt understand. This journey is amazing and at the same time challenging. I can speak from my experience as a mom, its not easy. There are good days and there are days i feel like giving up. The good thing is i try to stick to that still voice that says "don't give up". I am a firm believer that everyones learning process is very different. So i encourage those who feel like giving up "**to keep pushing**".
