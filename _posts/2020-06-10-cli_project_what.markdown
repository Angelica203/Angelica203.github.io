All i can say is wow! From being introduced to coding, learning new material in the first mile and after to, Now i have to build my own app ðŸ˜³. Well i can say it was a bit intimidating at first cause im still learning to comprehend *Ruby*. But putting time into my *Cli_project* i learned so much, such as Building a *Class *method, creating objects, Iterating with a Variable, and then making your code function correctly.

It also  lead me to go back to study the basics and  do tons of reasearch for every little thing i didnt understand. This journey is amazing and at the same time challenging. I can speak from my experience as a mom, its not easy. There are good days and there are days i feel like giving up.  But even if i wanted to give up my braing wont let me. I dream coding and also incorporate it in my daily life. 

So till then i will continue to pursue to learn more about this coding life. I am a firm believer that everyones learning process is very different. So i encourage those who feel like giving up "**to keep pushing**".
