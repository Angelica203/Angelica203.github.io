From building to debuging, there are numerous methods to build  out your controllers in your Sinatra project. Most of these techniques can be broken down by using Associates. And because Associates interact with each model thankfully it becomes easier in our functionality to make our application work.  Don't forget about the errors and getting stuck in nested hashes. For those issues there are different methods we can use to break through. So i say code on and dont worry whats to come you, will have some result :-).
